    A latent potential for emergent education in programming exists, but most
    of the widely available material focus on wasteful details and does not help
    the learner develop mental techniques to judge what is a beautiful program
    and how to manage its own thinking patterns.

    providing the tools for a person to become aesthetically proficient in
    programming, and through that develop administrative thinking patterns.
