\section{Conclusion}

I tried to convey an adequate way that if followed would benefit a person and
prepare it to became a competent programmer, not only in the sense of being able
to dish out code, but to think at several abstraction levels simultaneously. 

What I wish to stress is that the \emph{mastery} of this concepts takes
time\cite{programming:chamond__sod}, as much as a decade according to
\cite{education:norvig__teach_yourself_programming}. But to maintain a steady
progression one needs to develop a \emph{design taste}. That is what I hope the
path outlined here would provide.
