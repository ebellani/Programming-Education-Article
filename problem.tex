\section{The Problem}

With the advent of the Internet,  the potential to learn the necessary skills of
a good programmer is present for a motivated student or a community of
colleagues, mostly because top notch material is freely and widely available. 

But in the sea of information a lot of pitfalls await, and possibilities for lost
time and motivation are plenty. What can remedy that is that the individual
has some taste to be able to differentiate a bad source from a good source. 

But what kind of taste should people have? I find myself agreeing with
\cite{education:paul_graham__a_taste_for_makers}, because it is a consistent
and detailed list, and the author is a know software designer, who is famous for
prizing beauty, both technical and aesthetical.
